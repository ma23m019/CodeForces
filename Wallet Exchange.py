"""
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets. Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has 
b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each turn, the player will perform the following steps 
in order:
1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets.
2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step.

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and Bob play optimally, determine who will win the 
game.

Input: Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test 
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) — the number of coins in Alice's and 
Bob's wallets, respectively.

Output: For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if Bob will win the game.
